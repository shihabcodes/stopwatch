## Features

- **Start**: Begin the stopwatch to measure elapsed time.
- **Pause**: Pause the stopwatch to temporarily halt time measurement.
- **Reset**: Reset the stopwatch to zero.

## Usage

1. Clone the repository:

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/shihabcodes/stopwatch.git
    ```

2. Open `index.html` in a web browser to use the stopwatch.

3. Click the "Start" button to begin the timer, "Pause" to temporarily stop it, and "Reset" to set the timer back to zero.

## How It Works

The stopwatch keeps track of hours, minutes, and seconds. The timer starts when you click the "Start" button, pauses with the "Pause" button, and resets to zero with the "Reset" button.
